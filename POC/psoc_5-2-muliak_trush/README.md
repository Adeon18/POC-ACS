## Prerequisites

- Psoc Creator 4.4
- Psoc Programmer
- Tera Term(Or Putty), we used Tera Term for working with UART.

### Compilation

No Manual Compiltion is needed here.

### Installation

Just clone the repository and open it as a workspace in Psoc Creator.

### Tasks

- Task1:
    - Lab_1_1_LED.cydsn - We simply blink 2 different LEDs with some interval.
    - Lab_1_2_LED.cydsn - We blink 2 different LEDs with different intervals.
    - Lab_1_3_LED.cydsn - We change the brightness of the blue LED using PWM.
- Task2:
    - 
- Task1:
    - Lab_3_1_UART_Transmitting.cydsn - We set the UART transmittion speed to 9600.
    - Lab_3_2_UART_Transmitting.cydsn - We made it possible, so that when you type in a number and press enter, the number shows on the 7SEG, if the number has more than 4 characters, we print the last 4 characters.
    - Lab_3_3_UART_Floating_Point.cydsn - We made it possible to output positive and negative floating point numbers as well as whole numbers. Again, no more that 4 digit number, else only the last 4 digits are printed.
